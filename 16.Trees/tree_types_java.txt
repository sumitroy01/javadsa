Types of Trees in Java
=======================

1. Binary Tree
--------------
Diagram:
          (1)
         /   \
       (2)   (3)
      /   \
    (4)   (5)

- Each node has at most 2 children.
- No specific order of nodes.

Time Complexity:
- Insertion/Search: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

2. Binary Search Tree (BST)
----------------------------
Diagram:
          (8)
         /   \
       (3)   (10)
      /   \     \
    (1)   (6)   (14)

- Left < Root < Right
- Used for efficient searching and insertion.

Time Complexity:
- Best/Average: O(log n)
- Worst (unbalanced): O(n)
- Space: O(n)

3. AVL Tree (Self-balancing BST)
--------------------------------
Diagram:
          (30)
         /    \
      (20)   (40)
      /
    (10)

- Balanced BST: difference of heights of left and right subtrees is at most 1.
- Rotations are used to balance the tree.

Time Complexity:
- Insertion/Deletion/Search: O(log n)
- Space: O(n)

4. Red-Black Tree
-----------------
Diagram: (Colors not shown)
          (10)
         /    \
       (5)    (20)
              /   \
           (15)  (25)

- Balanced binary tree with extra color property (Red or Black).
- Used in Java's TreeMap and TreeSet.

Time Complexity:
- Insertion/Deletion/Search: O(log n)
- Space: O(n)

5. Heap (Min or Max)
---------------------
Min-Heap Diagram:
          (1)
         /   \
       (3)   (5)
      /   \
    (4)   (8)

- Complete binary tree.
- Min-heap: Parent ≤ Children
- Max-heap: Parent ≥ Children

Time Complexity:
- Insertion: O(log n)
- Get Min/Max: O(1)
- Space: O(n)

6. Trie (Prefix Tree)
----------------------
Diagram:
           (*)
          / | \
         a  b  c
        /      \
       t        a
      /          \
     e            t

- Stores strings character by character.
- Used for dictionary, autocomplete.

Time Complexity:
- Insertion/Search: O(L) where L = length of string
- Space: O(n * L)

7. N-ary Tree
--------------
Diagram:
           (1)
         / |  \
       (2)(3)(4)
       /       \
     (5)       (6)

- Each node can have up to N children.
- General-purpose tree structure.

Time Complexity:
- Traversals: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

Conclusion:
-----------
- Choose the tree based on your needs:
  - Use BST/AVL/Red-Black for fast lookups.
  - Use Trie for string operations.
  - Use Heap for priority queues.
  - Use N-ary for generic hierarchical data.



Binary Tree Properties
=======================

1. Maximum Nodes at Level i:
----------------------------
For a binary tree, the maximum number of nodes at level i (with root at level 0) is:

    Nodes at level i = 2^i


2. Maximum Total Nodes in a Tree of Height h (Perfect Binary Tree):
-------------------------------------------------------------------
For a perfect binary tree, where all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level:

    Total nodes = 2^(h + 1) - 1

Where:
    h = height (number of edges from root to the deepest leaf)


3. Minimum Height for n Nodes (in a Perfect Binary Tree):
----------------------------------------------------------
    Height = log2(n + 1) - 1

Where:
    n = total number of nodes


4. Number of Leaf Nodes in a Perfect Binary Tree:
-------------------------------------------------
    Leaf nodes = 2^h

Where:
    h = height of the tree
